# CL_lambda_calculus_interpreter
A not so throughly tested command line interpreter for lambda calculus
Here's what it can do:
  -declare functions with a name using the sintax `FUNCTION_NAME > param1 param2 paramn . paramn param2 param1`
  -evaluate functions when given parameters
  -give up when there is two functions with the same parameter name in the same scope
 
To stop evaluation early type `finish`
To close the program type `quit`

That is all. It is deeply untested and might still have some bugs.
This is a personal progect so criticism is appreciated since i always strive to be better.
